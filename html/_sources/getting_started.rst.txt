An overview of the learning environments
========================================

This MOOC uses several learning environments, which are directly accessible through your web browser.

`GitHub <https://www.github.com>`_ is a service for storing code, documentation and other materials. The learning materials and this website are hosted on GitHub.

`CSC Notebooks <https://notebooks.csc.fi>`_ is a cloud service provided by CSC â€“ IT Center for Science, a Finnish non-profit state enterprise. CSC Notebooks are used for running JupyterLab, which provides access to the interactive learning materials and the Python programming language. 

`TestMyCode <https://tmc.mooc.fi/>`_ is a programming assignment evaluator developed by the Agile Education Research group at the University of Helsinki. This MOOC uses TMC to download and automatically grade the course exercises and final examination.
